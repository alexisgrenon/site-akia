      **Living small is a new trend, and we think it is one that needs to last. It is hard not to realize what kind of impact human beings had on our planet and its ecosystems in the last decades. Our influence is growing more every year and it’s not on the positive side of the spectrum. We think that living tiny is not just a trend; it is a mindset.**
